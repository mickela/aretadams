SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is a serious consequence that can arise in patients who have been infected with the coronavirus.\n							 \n						\n						\n							COVID-19 is more prone to the propagation of the virus in nations with a high population density than in countries with a lower population density. As a result\, defeating the Corona virus is a major challenge for us.							 \n						\n					\n				\n				\n					\n											\n				\n			\n		\n		\n				\n				\n				\n							So we have to make sure the social distancing\, social service\, testing service and make the coordination better between people. That’s our biggest challenge to make sure.
